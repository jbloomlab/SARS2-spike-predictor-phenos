# CHANGELOG

Versions are tagged by date as `YYYY-MM-DD` when they are re-run.
Running the same code on different dates will give the same mutation-level predictions, but different clade-level predictions as new clades are constantly being designated, and their growth estimates are being update.

In addition, this CHANGELOG indicates when the code, configuration, or input data on the spike phenotypes are updated.

### Tag `2024-02-25`
Initial version of code.
